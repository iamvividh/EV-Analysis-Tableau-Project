# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis using Tableau

## Project Summary
This project explores the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
It analyzes Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), showing market growth trends, top manufacturers and models, state-wise adoption, average electric range, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to understand the electric vehicle landscape and provide meaningful insights using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

1. **Total Vehicles**  
   - Understand the overall EV market size and growth (including BEVs and PHEVs).

2. **Average Electric Range**  
   - Measure the average electric range to evaluate technological advancements and efficiency.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**  
   - Analyze the number and percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) to understand the dominance of fully electric models.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**  
   - Analyze the number and percentage of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to assess their market share.
